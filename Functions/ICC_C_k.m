%
%   DATA is a numerical matrix of ratings (missing values = NaN).
%   Each row is a single item and each column is a single rater.
%
%   ALPHA is the Type I error rate for the confidence interval (optional).
%
%   ICC is the reliability of the mean of the ratings from the included
%   raters. Reliability is gauged as consistency (not absolute agreement).
%
%   LB and UB are the confidence interval's lower and upper bounds.
