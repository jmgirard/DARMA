# DARMA
Software for Dual Axis Rating and Media Annotation
(c) Jeffrey M Girard, 2014-2018

DARMA is a media annotation program that collects continuous ratings while displaying audio and video files. It is designed to be highly user-friendly and easily customizable. DARMA enables researchers and study participants to provide moment-by-moment ratings of multimedia files using a computer joystick. The rating scale can be configured on a number of parameters including its labels and numerical range. Annotations can be displayed alongside the multimedia file and saved for easy import into statistical analysis software. DARMA provides a tool for researchers in affective computing, human-computer interaction, and the social sciences who need to capture the unfolding of subjective experience and observable behavior over time.
